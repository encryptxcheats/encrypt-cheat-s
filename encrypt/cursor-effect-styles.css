       If you have other elements with extremely high z-index (e.g., modals, fixed navbars),
       you might need to adjust their z-index or this one to ensure proper layering. */

/*
 * General advice for your website's main body style:
 * - Ensure your main body does not have 'overflow: hidden;' if you need scrolling.
 * The canvas handles its own overflow, but your body needs to scroll if content exceeds viewport.
 * - The background color of your <body> (or main content container) will be visible under the effect.
 * The JavaScript will use a matching color for the fading trail.
